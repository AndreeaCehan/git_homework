 was unaware of Centralized Version Control before, and it was a valuable experience to gain knowledge in this area. Additionally, there were certain Git commands, specifically 'git stash' and 'git pop,' that I was not familiar with because I primarily used SourceTree, where these functionalities are integrated into the user interface
